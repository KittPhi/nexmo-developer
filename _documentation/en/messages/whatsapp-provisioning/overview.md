# WhatsApp Provisioning API Overview

The WhatsApp Provisioning API enables you to deploy a WhatsApp cluster, perform one time password (OTP) verification, and update profile information for a WhatsApp business account.

The first thing you must do is [add a phone number](/messages/whatsapp-provisioning/add-phone-number) in your WhatsApp Business account dashboard.

Once you've added a phone number, you may [provision your WhatsApp deployment](/messages/whatsapp-provisioning/provision-deployment).

Finally, you may use the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/social-channels) to [manage your WhatsApp Business profile](/messages/whatsapp-provisioning/manage-profile).
