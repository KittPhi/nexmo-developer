# Add a phone number

In order to use the WhatsApp Manager API to create deployments, link your business account to a number, and manage your WhatsApp Business account profile, you must first add a phone number in your WhatsApp Business account.

To set up a phone number for your account:

1. Navigate to [Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings/whatsapp-business-accounts/). If you have access to multiple business managers, select the **Vonage** page.
2. Select the WhatsApp business account for which you want to set up a phone number. You can access the WhatsApp business account by selecting the **Settings** tab, then **WhatsApp Manager**.
    The account opens in a new page.
3. Navigate to the top bar and click **Phone Numbers**.
4. Click **Add Phone Number**.
5. Enter your phone number and display name. Your customers will see the display name when your messages appear in their WhatsApp app.
6. Click **Next**. You’ll see a confirmation that your display name has been sent for review.
7. Click **Done**. Your phone number will have a Name pending review label below **Certificate**. Once it’s approved, you’ll see a **View** button.
8. Below **Certificate**, click **View**. Download your certificate because you will need to use it when provisioning your WhatsApp cluster.

> **NOTE:** Each time you click the **View** button, the certificate will change. Either download or copy your certificate so you can use it in a subsequent step.

You may now [provision your WhatsApp deployment](/messages/whatsapp-provisioning/provision-deployment).
