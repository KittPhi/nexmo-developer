# Before You Begin

## What are Code Snippets?

Code snippets are short pieces of code you can reuse in your own applications.
The code snippets utilize code from the [Vonage Node Code Snippets](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-node-code-snippets) and [Vonage Curl Code Snippets](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-curl-code-snippets) repositories.

Please read this information carefully, so you can best use the code snippets.
