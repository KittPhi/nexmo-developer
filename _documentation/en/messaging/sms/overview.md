## Getting Started

### Important 10 DLC guidelines for US customers

10 DLC stands for 10 Digit Long Code. Major US carriers have announced their requirements for a new standard for application-to-person (A2P) messaging in the USA, which applies to all messaging over 10 digit geographic phone numbers, also know as 10 DLC. This new standard provides many benefits including supporting higher messaging speeds and better deliverability.

Customers using the Vonage SMS API to send traffic from a **+1 Country Code 10 Digit Long Code into US networks** will need to register a brand and campaign in order to get approval for sending messages. 

> **Note:** US numbers can no longer be shared across brands which include both geographic numbers and US Shared Short Codes.

> Vonage customers using US shared short codes:
T-Mobile and AT&Tâ€™s new code of conduct prohibits the use of shared originators, therefore, **Shared Short codes** will no longer be an acceptable format for A2P messaging.
    
    * Vonage customers using a Shared Short Code must migrate SMS traffic to either a [10 DLC](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027503992-US-10-DLC-Messaging), [Toll Free SMS Number](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011767768-Toll-free-Numbers-Features-Overview), or  [Dedicated Short Code](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050950831). 
    * Vonage customers using our Shared Short Code API ***must migrate*** to either our [SMS API](/messaging/sms/overview) or [Verify API](/verify/overview).
    * Customers using Dedicated Short Codes are not affected by these changes within the scope of 10 DLC.

To learn more about 10 DLC including important dates and carrier-specific information, see the knowledge base.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems when making API calls be sure to check the returned [status field](/messaging/sms/guides/troubleshooting-sms) for specific [error codes](/messaging/sms/guides/troubleshooting-sms#sms-api-error-codes).

## Concepts

Before using the Vonage SMS API, familiarize yourself with the following:

* **[Number format](/voice/voice-api/guides/numbers)** - The SMS API requires phone numbers in E.164 format.

* **[Authentication](/concepts/guides/authentication)** - The SMS API authenticates using your account API key and secret.

* **[Webhooks](/concepts/guides/webhooks)** - The SMS API makes HTTP requests to your application web server so that you can act upon them. For example: inbound SMS and delivery receipts.
