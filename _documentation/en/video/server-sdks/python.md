# Python Server SDK

The Vonage Video Python SDK lets you generate [sessions](/video/guides/create-session) and [tokens](/video/guides/create-token) for Vonage Video applications, and [archive](/video/guides/archiving/overview) Vonage Video sessions.

## Installation using Pip (recommended):

Pip helps manage dependencies for Python projects using the PyPI index. Find more info here: [http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/).

Add the `opentok` package as a dependency in your project. The most common way is to add it to your `requirements.txt` file:

```python
opentok>=3.0
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

### Initializing

Import the package at the top of any file where you will use it. At the very least you will need the `OpenTok` class. Then initialize a Vonage Video instance with your own API Key and API Secret.

```python
from opentok import OpenTok
opentok = OpenTok(api_key, api_secret)
```

### Creating Sessions

To create a Vonage Video Session, use the `opentok.create_session()` method. There are three optional keyword parameters for this method:

* `location` which can be set to a string containing an IP address.
* `media_mode` which is a String (defined by the MediaModes class). This determines whether the session will use the [Vonage Video Media Router](https://developer.vonage.com/video/guides/create-session#the-media-router-and-media-modes) or attempt to send streams directly between clients. A routed session is required for some Vonage Video features (such as archiving).
* `archive_mode` which specifies whether the session will be automatically archived (`always`) or not (`manual`).

This method returns a `Session` object. Its `session_id` attribute is useful when saving to a persistent store (such as a database).

```python
# Create a session that attempts to send streams directly between clients (falling back
# to use the Vonage Video TURN server to relay streams if the clients cannot connect):
session = opentok.create_session()

from opentok import MediaModes
# A session that uses the Vonage Video Media Router, which is required for archiving:
session = opentok.create_session(media_mode=MediaModes.routed)

# An automatically archived session:
session = opentok.create_session(media_mode=MediaModes.routed, archive_mode=ArchiveModes.always)

# A session with a location hint
session = opentok.create_session(location=u'12.34.56.78')

# Store this session ID in the database
session_id = session.session_id
```

### Generating Tokens

Once a Session is created, you can start generating Tokens for clients to use when connecting to it. You can generate a token either by calling the `opentok.generate_token(session_id)` method or by calling the `session.generate_token()` method on a `Session` instance after creating it. There is a set of optional keyword parameters: `role`, `expire_time`, `data`, and `initial_layout_class_list`.

```python
# Generate a Token from just a session_id (fetched from a database)
token = opentok.generate_token(session_id)
# Generate a Token by calling the method on the Session (returned from create_session)
token = session.generate_token()

from opentok import Roles
# Set some options in a token
token = session.generate_token(role=Roles.moderator,
                            expire_time=int(time.time()) + 10,
                            data=u'name=Johnny'
                            initial_layout_class_list=[u'focus'])
```

### Working with Archives

**Important:** You can only archive sessions that use the Vonage Video Media Router (sessions with the media mode set to routed).

You can start the recording of a Vonage Video Session using the `opentok.start_archive(session_id)` method. This method takes an optional keyword argument `name` to assign a name to the archive. This method will return an `Archive` instance. Note that you can only start an Archive on a Session that has clients connected.

```python
archive = opentok.start_archive(session_id, name=u'Important Presentation')

# Store this archive_id in the database
archive_id = archive.id
```    

You can also disable audio or video recording by setting the `has_audio` or `has_video` property of the `options` parameter to `false`:

```python
archive = opentok.start_archive(session_id, name=u'Important Presentation', has_video=False)

# Store this archive_id in the database
archive_id = archive.id
```    

By default, all streams are recorded to a single (composed) file. You can record the different streams in the session to individual files (instead of a single composed file) by setting the `output_mode` parameter of the `opentok.start_archive()` method to `OutputModes.individual`.

```python
archive = opentok.start_archive(session_id, name=u'Important Presentation', output_mode=OutputModes.individual)

# Store this archive_id in the database
archive_id = archive.id
```    

Composed archives (output_mode=OutputModes.composed) have an optional `resolution` parameter. If no value is supplied the Vonage Video platform will use the default resolution "640x480". You can set this to "1280x720" by setting the `resolution` parameter of the `opentok.start_archive()` method.

**Warning:** This value cannot be set for Individual output mode, an error will be thrown.

```python
archive = opentok.start_archive(session_id, name=u'Important Presentation', resolution="1280x720")

# Store this archive_id in the database
archive_id = archive.id
```

You can stop the recording of a started Archive using the `opentok.stop_archive(archive_id)` method. You can also do this using the `archive.stop()` method of an `Archive` instance.

```python
# Stop an Archive from an archive_id (fetched from database)
opentok.stop_archive(archive_id)
# Stop an Archive from an instance (returned from opentok.start_archive)
archive.stop()
```

To get an `Archive` instance (and all the information about it) from an archive ID, use the `opentok.get_archive(archive_id)` method.

```python
archive = opentok.get_archive(archive_id)
```

To delete an Archive, you can call the `opentok.delete_archive(archive_id)` method or the `archive.delete()` method of an `Archive` instance.

```
# Delete an Archive from an archive ID (fetched from database)
opentok.delete_archive(archive_id)
# Delete an Archive from an Archive instance (returned from opentok.start_archive or
opentok.get_archive)
archive.delete()
```

You can also get a list of all the Archives you've created (up to 1000) with your API Key. This is done using the `opentok.list_archives()` method. There are two optional keyword parameters: `count` and `offset`; they can help you paginate through the results. This method returns an instance of the `ArchiveList` class.

```python
archive_list = opentok.list_archive()

# Get a specific Archive from the list
archive = archive_list.items[i]

# Iterate over items
for archive in iter(archive_list):
pass

# Get the total number of Archives for this API Key
total = archive_list.total
```

Note that you can also create an automatically archived session, by passing in `ArchiveModes.always` as the `archive_mode` parameter when you call the `opentok.create_session()` method (see "Creating Sessions," above).

For composed archives, you can change the layout dynamically, using the `opentok.set_archive_layout(archive_id, type, stylesheet)` method:

```python
opentok.set_archive_layout('ARCHIVEID', 'horizontalPresentation')
```

Setting the layout of composed archives is optional. By default, composed archives use the `best fit` layout. Other valid values are: `custom`, `horizontalPresentation`, `pip` and `verticalPresentation`. If you specify a `custom` layout type, set the `stylesheet` parameter:

```python
opentok.set_archive_layout(
'ARCHIVEID',
'custom',
'stream.instructor {position: absolute; width: 100%;  height:50%;}'
)
```

For other layout types, do not set the stylesheet property. For more information see [Customizing the video layout for composed archives](/developer/guides/archiving/layout-control.html).

For more information on archiving, see the [Vonage Video archiving developer guide](/video/guides/archiving/overview).

## Sending Signals

Once a Session is created, you can send signals to everyone in the session or to a specific connection. You can send a signal by calling the `signal(session_id, payload)` method of the `OpenTok` class. The `payload` parameter is a dictionary used to set the `type`, `data` fields. á»²ou can also call the method with the parameter `connection_id` to send a signal to a specific connection `signal(session_id, data, connection_id)`.

```python
# payload structure
payload = {
'type': 'type', #optional
'data': 'signal data' #required
}

connection_id = '2a84cd30-3a33-917f-9150-49e454e01572'

# To send a signal to everyone in the session:
opentok.signal(session_id, payload)

# To send a signal to a specific connection in the session:
opentok.signal(session_id, payload, connection_id)
```

## Working with Streams

You can get information about a stream by calling the `get_stream(session_id, stream_id)` method of the `OpenTok` class.

The method returns a Stream object that contains information of an Vonage Video stream:

`id`: The stream ID

`videoType`: "camera" or "screen"

`name`: The stream name (if one was set when the client published the stream)

`layoutClassList`: It's an array of the layout classes for the stream

```python
session_id = 'SESSIONID'
stream_id = '8b732909-0a06-46a2-8ea8-074e64d43422'

# To get stream info:
stream = opentok.get_stream(session_id, stream_id)

# Stream properties:
print stream.id #8b732909-0a06-46a2-8ea8-074e64d43422
print stream.videoType #camera
print stream.name #stream name
print stream.layoutClassList #['full']
```

Also, you can get information about all the streams in a session by calling the `list_streams(session_id)` method of the `OpenTok` class.

The method returns a StreamList object that contains a list of all the streams

```python
# To get all streams in a session:
stream_list = opentok.list_streams(session_id)

# Getting the first stream of the list
stream = stream_list.items[0]

# Stream properties:
print stream.id #8b732909-0a06-46a2-8ea8-074e64d43422
print stream.videoType #camera
print stream.name #stream name
print stream.layoutClassList #['full']
```

## Force Disconnect

Your application server can disconnect a client from a Vonage Video session by calling the `force_disconnect(session_id, connection_id)` method of the `OpenTok` class, or the `force_disconnect(connection_id)` method of the `Session` class.

```python
session_id = 'SESSIONID'
connection_id = 'CONNECTIONID'

# To send a request to disconnect a client:
opentok.force_disconnect(session_id, connection_id)
```

## Working with SIP Interconnect

You can connect your SIP platform to a Vonage Video session, the audio from your end of the SIP call is added to the Vonage Video session as an audio-only stream. The Vonage Video Media Router mixes audio from other streams in the session and sends the mixed audio to your SIP endpoint.

```python
session_id = u('SESSIONID')
token = u('TOKEN')
sip_uri = u('sip:user@sip.partner.com;transport=tls')

# call the method with the required parameters
sip_call = opentok.dial(session_id, token, sip_uri)

# the method also support aditional options to establish the sip call

options = {
    'from': 'from@example.com',
    'headers': {
        'headerKey': 'headerValue'
    },
    'auth': {
        'username': 'username',
        'password': 'password'
    },
    'secure': True
}

# call the method with aditional options
sip_call = opentok.dial(session_id, token, sip_uri, options)
```

For more information, including technical details and security considerations, see the [Vonage Video SIP interconnect](/video/guides/sip-interconnect)developer guide.

## Working with Broadcasts

Vonage Video broadcast lets you share live Vonage Video sessions with many viewers.

You can use the `opentok.start_broadcast()` method to start a live streaming for a Vonage Video session. This broadcasts the session to an HLS (HTTP live streaming) or to RTMP streams.

To successfully start broadcasting a session, at least one client must be connected to the session.

The live streaming broadcast can target one HLS endpoint and up to five RTMP servers simultaneously for a session.

You can only start live streaming for sessions that use the Vonage Video Media Router; you cannot use live streaming with sessions that have the media mode set to relayed.

```python
session_id = 'SESSIONID'
options = {
'layout': {
    'type': 'custom',
    'stylesheet': 'the layout stylesheet (only used with type == custom)'
},
'maxDuration': 5400,
'outputs': {
    'hls': {},
    'rtmp': [{
    'id': 'foo',
    'serverUrl': 'rtmp://myfooserver/myfooapp',
    'streamName': 'myfoostream'
    }, {
    'id': 'bar',
    'serverUrl': 'rtmp://mybarserver/mybarapp',
    'streamName': 'mybarstream'
    }]
},
'resolution': '640x480'
}

broadcast = opentok.start_broadcast(session_id, options)
```

You can stop a started Broadcast using the `opentok.stop_broadcast(broadcast_id)` method.

```python
# getting the ID from a broadcast object
broadcast_id = broadcast.id

# stop a broadcast
broadcast = opentok.stop_broadcast(broadcast_id)
```

You can get details on a broadcast that is in-progress using the method `opentok.get_broadcast(broadcast_id)`.

```python
broadcast_id = '1748b7070a81464c9759c46ad10d3734'

# get broadcast details
broadcast = opentok.get_broadcast(broadcast_id)

print broadcast.json()

# print result
# {
#   "createdAt": 1437676551000,
#   "id": "1748b707-0a81-464c-9759-c46ad10d3734",
#   "projectId": 100,
#   "resolution": "640x480",
#   "sessionId": "2_MX4xMDBfjE0Mzc2NzY1NDgwMTJ-TjMzfn4",
#   "status": "started",
#   "updatedAt": 1437676551000,
#   "broadcastUrls": {
#       "hls": "http://server/fakepath/playlist.m3u8",
#       "rtmp": {
#           "bar": {
#               "serverUrl": "rtmp://mybarserver/mybarapp",
#               "status": "live",
#               "streamName": "mybarstream"
#           },
#           "foo": {
#               "serverUrl": "rtmp://myfooserver/myfooapp",
#               "status": "live",
#               "streamName": "myfoostream"
#           }
#       }
#   }
# }
```

You can dynamically change the layout type of a live streaming broadcast.

```python
# Valid values to 'layout_type' are: 'custom', 'horizontalPresentation',
# 'pip' and 'verticalPresentation' 
opentok.set_broadcast_layout('BROADCASTID', 'horizontalPresentation')

# if you specify a 'custom' layout type, set the stylesheet parameter:
opentok.set_broadcast_layout(
    'BROADCASTID',
    'custom',
    'stream.instructor {position: absolute; width: 100%;  height:50%;}'
)
```
