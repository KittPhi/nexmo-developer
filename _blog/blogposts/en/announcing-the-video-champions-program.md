## Understanding Customer Expectations Around Visual Engagement  

In the past two years, consumers’ expectations and attitudes towards turning on their cameras in business interactions have changed dramatically. We know because we’ve been asking consumers about their communications preferences for a long time–ten years and counting, and the [2021 Vonage Global Customer Engagement Report](https://www.vonage.com/resources/publications/global-customer-engagement-report-2021/) revealed a big shift:

* 55% have used video to connect with businesses and institutions
* 40% more people prefer to connect with businesses via a video chat
* 35% expect integrated communications when interacting with organizations

Here are four simple examples of how video makes your conversations more personal and effective:

* Showcase Your Product
* Build Trust with Users
* Offer Visual Support
* Help Solve a Problem


## Integrate Video Communication Into Your Apps With the Meetings API

With just a few lines of code, the Meetings API allows you to integrate high-quality, real-time video communications into your applications. With the Meetings API, you can create meetings, customize the theme to match your branding, record sessions, embed in your app or website for a seamless experience, and more. If you’re looking for a plug-and-play video solution for your next project, the Meetings API is for you! 

## Test the Meeting API for Free With the Video Champions Program


### Three Months Free Use 
Vonage is pleased to announce the launch of the Video API Champions Program, where each account will receive **three months free use** for up to 50K participant minutes and 25K recording minutes. A participant minute is counted per participant per minute they are in a session, and a recording minute is counted per minute that the session is recorded. 

Details on pricing outside of the Champions Program can be found below.

### Join the Program
To get started and begin using the API, please contact the Meetings API team by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/p3vVbPAqaWiGdzbU8).

## Meetings API Pricing Outside the Champions Program
The pricing is based on both participant and recording minutes. A participant minute is charged at $0.00475 per participant per minute in a session, while a recording minute is charged at $0.025 per minute that the session is recorded.

For example, it would cost $1.14 for a 1h call with 4 participants. If that call was recorded, those recording minutes would cost $1.50 for a total cost of $2.64.
