    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate the video [SDK](/video/resources#client-sdks) on your frontend.

    All applications that use the Vonage Video API are composed of two parts:

    - The client-side, which uses the [client SDKs](/video/resources#client-sdks) and runs in a userâ€™s browser.
    - The server-side, which uses the [server SDKs](/video/resources#server-sdks) and runs on your server to pass authentication information to the client-side.
    
    The Client SDKs take care of the following:

    - Connecting to a session
    - Publishing streams to a session
    - Subscribing to streams in a session

    You can learn about the above concepts and SDKs on the [overview page](/video/overview).

    ### Completed project
    You will find the completed web client code in the **Basic Video Chat folder** of our [Web sample app GitHub repository](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-web-samples). The repo includes a README with documentation on how to run the code.

    *This tutorial uses [Opentok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentok/client) version 2.0*.

    # What's next?
    Once the frontend integration is complete, the next step is to [integrate the server-side SDK to handle authentication] (/video/tutorials/server-side-setup/introduction).

    You can also learn more about the video platform concepts via the [overview page](/video/overview).
