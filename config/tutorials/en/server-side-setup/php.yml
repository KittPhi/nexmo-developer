    # Introduction
    Its possible to get a working video conferencing application by hard coding your authentication credentials on the [client-side](/video/tutorials/create-video-conferencing-app/video/create-video-conferencing-app/javascript/auth-setup/javascript). However, for a production application, the **sessionId** and **token** values in your code must be generated by your server and passed to the client. 
    
    Here are a couple of reasons why you don't want hard coded credentials in your production app:

    - Tokens expire after a certain amount of time (specified when generated), so new ones need to be generated regularly.
    - You won't be able to create new sessions dynamically, so everyone using your app would be stuck in a single "room".
    
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate authentication credentials on the server-side using PHP.
