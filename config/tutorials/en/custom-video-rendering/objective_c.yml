    # Introduction
    This tutorial walks through the steps required to make minor modifications to the video renderer used by an OTPublisher object.
    
    You can also use the same techniques to modify the video renderer used by an `OTSubscriber` object (though this example only illustrates a custom renderer for a publisher).

    For conceptual information on the video API, see the [General overview page](/video/overview).
