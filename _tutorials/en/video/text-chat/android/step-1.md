## Getting Started

The code for this section is available in the Signaling project of the [opentok-android-sdk-samples](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples/) repo. If you haven't already, you'll need to clone the repo into a local directory. On the command line, run:

`git clone git@github.com:opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples.git`

Open the **Signaling** project in Android Studio to follow along.

You'll need to enter in authentication credentials for AppID, session ID, and token, in `OpenTokConfig` file. You can find these values in your [Vonage Video Dashboard](https://tokbox.com/account/#/).
