### Getting your API credentials

To connect to a video session, the client will need access to some authentication credentials thus an **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token**. 

In a production application, these credentials should be generated by a server, but to speed things up we will hard code the values for now.


1. Follow the steps below to generate your **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token**
    1. Log into your [Video API account](https://tokbox.com/account)
    2. Either create a new Video API project or use an existing video API project.
    3. Go to your project page and scroll down to the **Project Tools** section.
    4. From the Project Tools section, you can generate a **Session ID** and **Token** manually.

2. Use the project's API Key along with the Session ID and Token you generated to replace **YOUR_API_KEY**, **YOUR_SESSION_ID** and **YOUR_TOKEN** in the code that comes after the `// Creating a room` comment (be sure to leave the quotation marks).:

> You can continue to generate the session ID and token values from your account during testing and development, but before you go into production you must set up a server to generate them. See the [server-side tutorial](/video/tutorials/server-side-setup) to learn how to do this.

Visit the [overview](/video/overview) page to learn more about tokens and sessions.

The next step is to [test your code in a browser](/video/tutorials/create-video-conferencing-app-express/video/create-video-conferencing-app-express/javascript/testing/javascript).
