## Using sessions in client applications

Use the session ID in an [Vonage Video client SDK](/video/client-sdks/overview) to connect to an OpenTok session.

You will also need to generate a token for each user connecting to the OpenTok session. See [Connection Token Creation](/video/tutorials/create-token) for information on the `GenerateToken()` method.
