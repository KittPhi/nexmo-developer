## Using sessions in client applications

Use the session ID in an [Vonage Video client SDK](/video/tutorials/create-token/introduction/node) to connect to a Vonage Video session.

You will also need to generate a token for each user connecting to the Vonage Video session. See [Connection Token Creation](/developer/guides/create-token/ruby/) for information on the `generate_token()` method.
