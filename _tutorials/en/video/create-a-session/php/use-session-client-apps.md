## Using sessions in client applications

Use the session ID with the [OpenTok client SDK](/video/resources#client-sdks) to [connect to an OpenTok session](/video/tutorials/joining-a-session).

<!-- OPT-TODO: You will also need to generate a token for each user connecting to the Vonage Video session. See [Connection Token Creation](/developer/guides/create-token/php/) for information on the `generateToken()` method. -->
