## Using sessions in client applications

Use the session ID with the [client SDK](/video/resources#client-sdks) to [connect to a session](/video/tutorials/joining-a-session).

You will also need to generate a token for each user connecting to the Vonage Video session. See [Connection Token Creation](/video/tutorials/create-token/introduction/php) for information on the `generateToken()` method.
