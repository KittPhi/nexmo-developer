## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Vonage Video iOS SDK to publish a screen-sharing video, using the device screen as the source for the stream's video.

## Setting Up Your Project

The code for this section is in the **screen-sharing** branch of the [learning-opentok-ios repo](https://github.com/opentok/learning-opentok-ios), so if you haven't already, you'll need to clone the repo into a local directory â€” **this can be done using the command line**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opentok/learning-opentok-ios.git
```

Then check out the branch:

```sh
git checkout screen-sharing
```

This branch shows you how to capture the screen (a UIView) using a custom video capturer. Open the project in XCode to follow along.
