## Setting up the server

In order to archive Vonage Video sessions (to save recordings of sessions), you need to have a server set up.

There are many ways to implement archiving with a server, but for this tutorial we'll be quick-launching a PHP server.

To launch the server, click the Heroku button below, at which point you'll be sent to Heroku's website and prompted for your Vonage Video API Key and API Secret — you can get these values on your project page in your [Video API account](https://ui.idp.vonage.com/ui/auth/login?icid=nexmocustomer_api-developer-adp_nexmodashbdsigin_nav).

If you don't have a Heroku account, you'll need to sign up.

**Want to explore the code?** The button above launches server code from the [learning-opentok-php](https://github.com/opentok/learning-opentok-php) GitHub repo.

Visit the repo to review the code as well as additional documentation — you can even fork the repo and make changes before deploying.
