## Setting up a web service to provide the EU proxy server URL

Instead of hard coding the EU proxy URL from Vonage directly into your client app, its better to setup a web service to send the URL to the client side.

This way when you are issued with a new proxy URL, your client app wouldn't need to be updated.
