## Setting Up Your Project

The code for this section is in the **Basic Video Renderer** project of the [opentok-ios-sdk-samples repo](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-ios-sdk-samples), so if you haven't already, you'll need to clone the repo into a local directory â€” **this can be done using the command line**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opentok/opentok-ios-sdk-samples.git
```

Change directory to the Basic Video Renderer project:

```sh
cd opentok-ios-sdk-samples/Basic-Video-Renderer
```

Then install the Vonage Video dependency:

```sh
pod install
```

Open the project in Xcode to follow along.
