## Overview

The Vonage Video iOS SDK lets you set up a custom audio driver for publishers and subscribers. You can use a custom audio driver to customize the audio sent to a publisher's stream. You can also customize the playback of a subscribed streams' audio.

## Setting up your project

The code for this section is in the **audio-driver** branch of the [learning-opentok-ios repo](https://github.com/opentok/learning-opentok-ios), so if you haven't already, you'll need to clone the repo into a local directory â€” **this can be done using the command line**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opentok/learning-opentok-ios.git
```

Then check out the branch:

```sh
git checkout audio-driver
```

Open the project in XCode to follow along.
