## Overview

The Vonage Video Android SDK lets you set up a custom audio driver for publishers and subscribers. You can use a custom audio driver to customize the audio sent to a publisher's stream. You can also customize the playback of subscribed streams' audio.

## Setting Up Your Project

The code for this section is available in the Basic-Audio-Driver-Java project of the [opentok-android-sdk-samples](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples/) repo. If you haven't already, you'll need to clone the repo into a local directory. On the command line, run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples.git
```

Open the **Basic-Audio-Java** project in Android Studio to follow along.

**Note:** This tutorial discusses the Java version of the Android sample app. For a Kotlin version with documentation, see the [Android sample app repo](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples).
