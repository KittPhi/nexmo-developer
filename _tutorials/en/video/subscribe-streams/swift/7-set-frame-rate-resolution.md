## Setting the preferred frame rate and resolution

When subscribing to a stream that uses the [scalable video feature](/video/guides/scalable-video), you can set the preferred frame rate and resolution for the stream the subscribing client receives from the Vonage Video Media Router.

For details, see [`SubscriberKit.preferredFrameRate`](/sdk/stitch/video-ios-reference/Classes/OTSubscriberKit.html#//api/name/preferredFrameRate) and [`SubscriberKit.preferredResolution`](/sdk/stitch/video-ios-reference/Classes/OTSubscriberKit.html#//api/name/preferredResolution).
