# Overview

All applications that use the Vonage Video API require both a [client](/video/client-sdks/overview) and a [Server SDKs](/video/server-sdks/overview) component. The client-side code is what loads in an end-user’s device (phone, computer) and handles the majority of OpenTok functionality, including [connecting](/video/overview/#connection) to the [session](/video/overview/#session), [publishing](/video/overview/#publish) audio-video [streams](/video/overview/#stream) to the session, and [subscribing](/video/overview/#subscribe) to other clients’ streams. For more information on clients, servers, and sessions, see [Video API Basics](/video/overview).
