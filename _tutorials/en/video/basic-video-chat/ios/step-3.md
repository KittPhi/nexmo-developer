## Setting Up Authentication

In order to connect to a Vonage Video session, the client will need access to some authentication credentials â€” an **API key**, **session ID**, and **token**. In a production application, these credentials should be generated by a [Server SDKs](/video/server-sdks/overview), but to speed things up we will hard code the values for now:

1. Start by copying the following code block and adding it to your ViewController.m file:

```objc
// Replace with your Vonage Video APP ID
static NSString* kAppID = @"";
// Replace with your generated session ID
static NSString* kSessionId = @"";
// Replace with your generated token
static NSString* kToken = @"";
```

Add these lines before the `@interface` declaration.

2. Adjust the code by hard coding the values for the `kAppID`, `kSessionId` and `kToken` (inside the empty quotation marks).

To do this, log into your [Video API account](https://www.tokbox.com/account/user/signup), either create a new Vonage Video API project or use an existing Vonage Video API project, then go to your project page and scroll down to the **Project Tools** section. From there, you can generate a session ID and token manually. Use the project's API key along with the session ID and token you generated.

**Important:** You can continue to get the session ID and token values from your Account during testing and development, but before you go into production you must set up a server.
