# Getting Started

In this tutorial, you will be utilizing the [Vonage Video iOS SDK](/video/client-sdks/ios/overview), Vonage Video's client-side library for iOS devices, to quickly  build a real-time interactive video application.

**Note:** The code in this tutorial is written in Objective-C. There is also a tutorial with the code written in [Swift](/video/tutorials/basic-video-chat/introduction/swift).
