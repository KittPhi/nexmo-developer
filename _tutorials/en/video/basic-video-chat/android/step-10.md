**Congratulations! You've finished the 'Set up a Basic Android Client' tutorial.**  
You can continue to play with and adjust the code you've developed here for the client-side of your application, but keep in mind that you'll need to implement the **server component** of your application before going to production (see [Server Side SDK](/video/server-sdks/overview)).

You can view a completed version of this sample app in the **Basic-Video-Chat-Java** folder of the [opentok-android-sdk-samples](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-android-sdk-samples) repo on GitHub. This completed version adds code to load the session ID, token, and API key from a web service (instead of using hard-coded values).

# Next Steps

When you're finished here, continue building and enhancing your Vonage Video application with these helpful resources:

* [server SDK](/video/server-sdks/overview) — Before going to production, you'll need to set up a server to generate credentials.
* [Video API Basics](/video/overview) — If you haven't already, take a few minutes to learn exactly how Vonage Video works.
* [Developer Guides](/video/guides/create-token) — detailed documentation on all Vonage Video features and functionality.
* Check out the tutorials section — walkthroughs for implementing other Vonage Video features and use cases.
* [Android SDK Reference](/sdk/stitch/video-android-reference/) — explore the methods and events associated with the Vonage Video Android SDK.
