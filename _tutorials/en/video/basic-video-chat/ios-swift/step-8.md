**Congratulations! You've finished the 'Set up a Basic iOS Client (Swift)' tutorial.**

You can continue to play with and adjust the code you've developed here for the client-side of your application, but keep in mind that you'll need to implement the **server component** of your application before going to production (see [Server SDKs](/video/server-sdks/overview) below).

You can view a completed version of this sample app in the **Basic-Video-Chat** folder of the [opentok-ios-sdk-samples-swift](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-ios-sdk-samples-swift) repo on GitHub. This completed version adds code to load the session ID, token, and API key from a web service (instead of using hard coded values).

## Next Steps

When you're finished here, continue building and enhancing your Vonage Video application with these helpful resources:

* [Server SDK](/video/server-sdks/overview) — Before going to production, you'll need to set up a server to generate credentials
* [Video API Basics](/video/overview) — If you haven't already, take a few minutes to learn exactly how Vonage Video works
* Visit the guides section for detailed documentation on all Vonage Video features and functionality
* Visit the tutorials section for walkthroughs on implementing other Vonage Video features and use cases
* [iOS SDK Reference](/sdk/stitch/video-ios-reference/) — explore the specific methods and events associated with Vonage Video iOS SDK.
