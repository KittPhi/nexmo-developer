## Next Steps

**Congratulations! You've finished the 'Set up a Basic Web Client' tutorial.**  
You can continue to play with and adjust the code you've developed here for the client-side of your application, but keep in mind that you'll need to implement the **server component** of your application before going to production (see [Server SDKs](/video/server-sdks/overview) below).

When you're finished here, continue building and enhancing your Vonage Video application with these helpful resources:

* [Server SDK](/video/server-sdks/overview) — Before going to production, you'll need to set up a server to generate credentials
* [Video API Basics](/video/overview) — If you haven't already, take a few minutes to learn exactly how Vonage Video works
* [Vonage Video.js reference](/sdk/stitch/video-js-reference/) — explore the specific methods and events associated with Vonage Video.js
