## A little bit of CSS customization

At this point, you have a complete working client using Vonage Video. This last step will demonstrate some basic CSS customization to produce a "picture-in-picture" layout.

1. Open up your blank app.css file in your code editor and add the following code to it:

```css
body, html {
    background-color: gray;
    height: 100%;
}

#videos {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}

#subscriber {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    z-index: 10;
}

#publisher {
    position: absolute;
    width: 360px;
    height: 240px;
    bottom: 10px;
    left: 10px;
    z-index: 100;
    border: 3px solid white;
    border-radius: 3px;
}
```

2. Once you've saved the CSS, reopen your index in two separate browser tabs again â€” you should now see two video streams, but one will be smaller and nested inside the larger video stream.

Taking a look at the CSS above, you can see that we did this by adjusting the height, width, and position of the `#publisher` div. This "picture-in-picture" layout is a common practice in video chats, but feel free to adjust the CSS to play with the sizing and position of these divs as much as you like.
