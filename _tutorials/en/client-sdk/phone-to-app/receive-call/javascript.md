# Run your application

Open `client_js.html` in a browser.

The callâ€™s current status and an Answer button are displayed on the page.

You can now call the Vonage number associated with your Client SDK application.

You will hear a message saying to wait while you are connected through to an agent.

In your web app, you will see the call status updated. Click the `Answer` button to answer the inbound call.

A conversation can now take place between the web app (agent) and the inbound caller.

Hang up when you're done and the call status will be updated again.

## Webhooks

As you proceed with the call, please switch to the terminal and notice the `/voice/answer` endpoint being called to retrieve the NCCO:

```bash
NCCO request:
  - caller: 447700900000
  - callee: 442038297050
```

Also, as the call progresses through various stages, `/voice/event` is being sent events:

```bash
